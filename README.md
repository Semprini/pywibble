## Why wibble?
Based on the definition at [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wibble). Wibble is defined as babble and also a [metasyntactic variable](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metasyntactic_variable#English) (which also sounds like babble). However this does provide a slim justification as to why a CDC should be called wibble. Actually, I'm just a Blackadder fan.
